I asked myself the other day what I am striving to achieve at the moment. I thought this over and over in my head. Have I arrived at something yet? I have.

What exactly do I want to accomplish by the end of 2022? The answer to this I will gradually discuss in this article as I develop it. 

And so begins the first proper article I document and retain to display, and so commences the history of what starts of as nothing but a beginning.
