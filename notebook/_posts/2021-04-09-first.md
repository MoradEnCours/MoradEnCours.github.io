    “Begin at the beginning,” the King said, very gravely, “and go on till you come to the end: then stop.” “Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?” “That depends a good deal on where you want to get to.”

Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore

While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,

As of someone gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door."
