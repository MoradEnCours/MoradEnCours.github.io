## Background
I will progressively start to complete this section as I gain the inspiration to do so. For now, I am merely some random student that is trying to configure and write up his website.

> Note:

* I am currently configuring a Linkedin profile but the site itself is very clunky to deal with.<br/>

* Likewise, I might make a discord account eventually.
